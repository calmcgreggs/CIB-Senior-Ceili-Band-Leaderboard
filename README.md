# Comhaltas in Britain Senior Ceili Band Leaderboard

## Getting Started

Download the respository remotely or using git clone and unzip if needed.

Install Node.JS, and then run "npm install" inside each subfolder of the package in order to download the required dependencies.

To start the program, run the two bat files in this folder. This will activate the emulator that allows for the local backend, as well as start both of the programs. Failing this, navigate to each subfolder in this directory and run the command in the terminal "npm run start"

## Accessing the interfaces

When starting the activation scripts, the web addresses will be shown for the leaderboard and the data input system. These are usually http://localhost:3000/ and http://localhost:3001/ . The backend web address will also be shown if needed for any reason.
